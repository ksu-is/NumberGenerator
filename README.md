It will have a database with the lottery number sequences that have been recently pulled within the past three years, and the winning lottery numbers. This software will be able to pull the lottery numbers that have been picked through the database. With that data it will go a random number generator to give you a sequence of numbers that could possibly be pulled. It will be able to take that data and come up with a set of numbers based on the frequency that they are drawn. When you use the software, you will click a button it will generate a sequence of numbers for you based on the data provided.
